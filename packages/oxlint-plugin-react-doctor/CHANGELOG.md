- [#266](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/266) [`529015d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/529015d1d89441c4708f49413ecd540db7c04255) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Scope React Native rules to per-package boundaries. Previously every
  `rn-*` rule fired on every file in a project whose top-level framework
  was detected as React Native or Expo — even on sibling workspaces that
  were clearly web targets. In a mixed RN + web monorepo (`apps/mobile`
  alongside `apps/web` and `packages/storybook`) the rules would noisily
  report issues against Next.js, Vite, Docusaurus, Storybook, and plain
  React DOM packages where they don't apply.

  React Native rules now walk up to the file's nearest `package.json`
  before running. The rule body is skipped when the package declares a
  web-only framework (`next`, `vite`, `react-scripts`, `gatsby`,
  `@remix-run/react`, `@docusaurus/core`, `@storybook/*`, or plain
  `react-dom` without an RN sibling) and stays active when the package
  declares `react-native`, `expo`, `react-native-tvos`, `react-native-windows`,
  `react-native-macos`, anything under the `@react-native/` or
  `@react-native-` community namespaces (`@react-native-firebase/*`,
  `@react-native-async-storage/*`, `@react-native-community/*`, …), or
  Metro's top-level `"react-native"` resolution field.

  The detection is bidirectional: a web-rooted monorepo (root
  `package.json` declares `next` or `vite`) still loads `rn-*` rules
  when any workspace targets React Native or Expo, so the rules now
  fire on `apps/mobile` of a `next`-rooted repo as well as the inverse
  layout that the file-level boundary alone covered.

  `rn-no-raw-text` additionally skips raw text inside `Platform.OS === "web"`
  branches: `if`, `?:`, and `&&` / `||` short-circuits, the mirror
  `Platform.OS !== "web"` else branches, `switch (Platform.OS) { case "web": … }`
  case bodies, and the `web` arm of `Platform.select({ web: …, default: … })`.
  Optional chaining (`Platform?.OS`) and the TS non-null assertion
  (`Platform.OS!`) parse the same way as the bare form. The walker stops
  at function and `Program` boundaries so JSX defined inside a callback
  hoisted out of a `Platform.OS` branch does not inherit the parent
  guard.

  Native-only file extensions (`.ios.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.native.tsx`)
  keep the rule active even when the surrounding package classification
  is ambiguous.
